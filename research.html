				Robust Estimation of Realized Correlation: New Insight about Intraday Fluctuations in Market Betas
			</button>
    		<div class="content">
        		<p>Co-author(s): Yiyao Luo</p>
        		<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19992"">[ArXiv]</a></p>
        		<p><b>Abstract:</b> Time-varying volatility is an inherent feature of most economic time-series,
				which causes standard correlation estimators to be inconsistent. The quadrant correlation estimator
				is consistent but very inefficient. We propose a novel subsampled quadrant estimator that improves
				efficiency while preserving consistency and robustness. This estimator is particularly well-suited
				for high-frequency financial data and we apply it to a large panel of US stocks. Our empirical analysis sheds
				new light on intra-day fluctuations in market betas by decomposing them into time-varying correlations and relative volatility changes.
				Our results show that intraday variation in betas is primarily driven by intraday variation in correlations.</p>

				Option Pricing with Time-Varying Volatility Risk Aversion

        			<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06943"">[ArXiv]</a></p>
        			<p><b>Abstract:</b> We introduce a novel pricing kernel with time-varying variance risk aversion that yields closed-form expressions for the VIX. We also obtain closed-form expressions for option prices with a novel approximation method. The model can explain the observed time-variation in the shape of the pricing kernel. We estimate the model with S&P 500 returns and option prices and find that time-variation in volatility risk aversion brings a substantial reduction in derivative pricing errors. The variance risk ratio emerges as a fundamental variable and we show that it is closely related to economic fundamentals and key measures of sentiment and uncertainty.</p>

				A Multivariate Realized GARCH Model

        			<p>Co-author(s): Ilya Archakov, Asger Lunde</p>
        			<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02708"">[ArXiv]</a></p>
        			<p><b>Abstract:</b> We propose a novel class of multivariate GARCH models that utilize realized measures of volatilities and correlations. The central component is an unconstrained vector parametrization of the correlation matrix that facilitates modeling of the correlation structure. The parametrization is based on the matrix logarithmic transformation that retains the positive definiteness as an innate property. A factor approach offers a way to impose a parsimonious structure in high dimensional system and we show that a factor framework arises naturally in some existing models. We apply the model to returns of nine assets and employ the factor structure that emerges from a block correlation specification. An auxiliary empirical finding is that the empirical distribution of parametrized realized correlations is approximately Gaussian. This observation is analogous to the well-known result for logarithmically transformed realized variances.

        			<p><b>Abstract:</b> The Clustered Factor (CF) model induces a block structure on the correlation matrix and is commonly used to parameterize correlation matrices. Our results reveal that the CF model imposes superfluous restrictions on the correlation matrix. This can be avoided by a different parametrization, involving the logarithmic transformation of the block correlation matrix.

				A New Method for Generating Random Correlation Matrices

        			<p><b>Abstract:</b> We propose a new method for generating random correlation matrices that makes it simple to control both location and dispersion. The method is based on a vector parameterization,
					<script type="math/tex">\gamma=g(C)</script>, which maps any distribution on
					<script type="math/tex">\mathbb{R}^d,\ d = n(n-1)/2</script> to a distribution on the space of non-singular nxn correlation matrices. Correlation matrices with certain properties, such as being well-conditioned, having block structures, and having strictly positive elements, are simple to generate. We compare the new method with existing methods.

				Option Pricing with State-dependent Pricing Kernel

        			<p><b>Abstract:</b> We introduce a new volatility model for option pricing that combines Markov switching with the Realized GARCH framework. This leads to a novel pricing kernel with a state-dependent variance risk premium and a pricing formula for European options, which is derived with an analytical approximation method. We apply the Markov switching Realized GARCH model to S&P 500 index options from 1990 to 2019 and find that investors' aversion to volatility-specific risk is time-varying. The proposed framework outperforms competing models and reduces (in-sample and out-of-sample) option pricing errors by 15% or more.

				Realized GARCH, CBOE VIX, and the Volatility Risk Premium

   			<div class="content">
       			<p>Hansen, P.R., A. Huang, C. Tong, and T Wang (2024) <i>Journal of Financial Econometrics</i> Vol. 22, 187–223.</p>
       			<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05302">[ArXiv]</a></p>
       			<p><b>Abstract:</b> We show that the Realized GARCH model yields close-form expression for both the Volatility Index (VIX) and the volatility risk premium (VRP). The Realized GARCH model is driven by two shocks, a return shock and a volatility shock, and these are natural state variables in the stochastic discount factor (SDF). The volatility shock endows the exponentially affine SDF with a compensation for volatility risk. This leads to dissimilar dynamic properties under the physical and risk-neutral measures that can explain time-variation in the VRP. In an empirical application with the S&P 500 returns, the VIX, and the VRP, we find that the Realized GARCH model significantly outperforms conventional GARCH models.

				Relative Contagiousness of Emerging Virus Variants: An Analysis of the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 Variants

   			<div class="content">
       			<p>Hansen, P.R. (2022) <i>Econometrics Journal</i> Vol. 25, 739-761.</p>
       			<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00533">[ArXiv]</a>   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5kkwe3aXLM">[YouTube]</a></p>
       			<p><b>Abstract:</b> We propose a simple dynamic model for estimating the relative contagiousness of two virus variants. Maximum likelihood estimation and inference is conveniently invariant to variation in the total number of cases over the sample period and can be expressed as a logistic regression. We apply the model to Danish SARS-CoV-2 variant data. We estimate the reproduction numbers of Alpha and Delta to be larger than that of the ancestral variant by a factor of 1.51 [CI 95%: 1.50, 1.53] and 3.28 [CI 95%: 3.01, 3.58], respectively. In a predominately vaccinated population, we estimate Omicron to be 3.15 [CI 95%: 2.83, 3.50] times more infectious than Delta. Forecasting the proportion of an emerging virus variant is straight forward and we proceed to show how the effective reproduction number for a new variant can be estimated without contemporary sequencing results. This is useful for assessing the state of the pandemic in real time as we illustrate empirically with the inferred effective reproduction number for the Alpha variant.

				How should parameter estimation be tailored to the objective?

   			<div class="content">
       			<p>Hansen, P.R. and E. Dumitrescu (2022) <i>Journal of Econometrics</i> Vol. 230, 535-558.</p>
       			<p><a href="papers/InSampleOutofSampleCriteria.pdf">[PDF]</a></p>
       			<p><b>Abstract:</b>
					We study parameter estimation from the sample <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{X}</script>, when
					the objective is to maximize the expected value of a criterion function,
					<script type="math/tex">Q</script>, for a distinct sample, <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{Y}</script>. This is the situation
					that arises when a model is estimated for the purpose of describing
					other data than those used for estimation, such as in forecasting
					problems. A natural candidate for solving <script type="math/tex">\max_{T\in\sigma(\mathcal{X})}\mathbb{E}Q(\mathcal{Y},T)</script>
					is the <i>innate</i> estimator, <script type="math/tex">\hat{\theta}=\arg\max_{\theta}Q(\mathcal{X},\theta)</script>.
					While the innate estimator has certain advantages, we show that the
					asymptotically efficient estimator takes the form <script type="math/tex">\tilde{\theta}=\arg\max_{\theta}\tilde{Q}(\mathcal{X},\theta)</script>,
					where <script type="math/tex">\tilde{Q}</script> is defined from a likelihood function in conjunction
					with <script type="math/tex">Q</script>. The likelihood-based estimator is, however, fragile, as
					misspecification is harmful in two ways. First, the likelihood-based
					estimator may be inefficient under misspecification. Second, and more
					importantly, the likelihood approach requires a parameter transformation
					that depends on the true model, causing an improper mapping to be
					used under misspecification.

				A New Parametrization of Correlation Matrices

       			<p><b>Abstract:</b> We introduce a novel parametrization of the correlation matrix. The reparametriza- tion facilitates modeling of correlation and covariance matrices by an unrestricted vector, where positive definiteness is an innate property. This parametrization can be viewed as a generalization of Fisher’s Z-transformation to higher dimensions and has a wide range of potential applications. An algorithm for reconstructing the unique <script type="math/tex">n\times n</script> correlation matrix from any vector in <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{R}^d,\ d = n(n-1)/2</script> is provided, and we derive its numerical complexity.

				A Canonical Representation of Block Matrices with Applications to Covariance and Correlation Matrices

       			<p>Archakov, I, and P.R. Hansen (2024) <i>Review of Economics and Statistics</i></p>
       			<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02698">[ArXiv]</a></p>
       			<p><b>Abstract:</b> We obtain a canonical representation for block matrices. The representation facilitates simple computation of the determinant, the matrix inverse, and other powers of a block matrix, as well as the matrix logarithm and the matrix exponential. These results are particularly useful for block covariance and block correlation matrices, where evaluation of the Gaussian log-likelihood and estimation are greatly simplified. We illustrate this with an empirical application using a large panel of daily asset returns. Moreover, the representation paves new ways to regularizing large covariance/correlation matrices, test block structures in matrices, and estimate regressions with many variables.

				Periodicity in Cryptocurrency Volatility and Liquidity

       			<p><b>Abstract:</b> We study recurrent patterns in volatility and volume for major cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ether, using data from two centralized exchanges (Coinbase Pro and Binance) and a decentralized exchange (Uniswap V2). We find systematic patterns in both volatility and volume across day-of-the-week, hour-of-the-day, and within the hour. These patterns have grown stronger over the years and can be related to algorithmic trading and funding times in futures markets. We also document that price formation mainly takes place on the centralized exchanges while price adjustments on the decentralized exchanges can be sluggish.
