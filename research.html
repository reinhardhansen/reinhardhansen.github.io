				Robust Estimation of Realized Correlation: New Insight about Intraday Fluctuations in Market Betas

        		<p>Co-author(s): Yiyao Luo</p>
        		<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19992"">[ArXiv]</a></p>
        		<p><b>Abstract:</b> Time-varying volatility is an inherent feature of most economic time-series,
				which causes standard correlation estimators to be inconsistent. The quadrant correlation estimator
				is consistent but very inefficient. We propose a novel subsampled quadrant estimator that improves
				efficiency while preserving consistency and robustness. This estimator is particularly well-suited
				for high-frequency financial data and we apply it to a large panel of US stocks. Our empirical analysis sheds
				new light on intra-day fluctuations in market betas by decomposing them into time-varying correlations and relative volatility changes.
				Our results show that intraday variation in betas is primarily driven by intraday variation in correlations.</p>

        			<p><b>Abstract:</b> We introduce a novel pricing kernel with time-varying variance risk aversion that yields closed-form expressions for the VIX. We also obtain closed-form expressions for option prices with a novel approximation method. The model can explain the observed time-variation in the shape of the pricing kernel. We estimate the model with S&P 500 returns and option prices and find that time-variation in volatility risk aversion brings a substantial reduction in derivative pricing errors. The variance risk ratio emerges as a fundamental variable and we show that it is closely related to economic fundamentals and key measures of sentiment and uncertainty.</p>

				A Multivariate Realized GARCH Model

        			<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02708"">[ArXiv]</a></p>
        			<p><b>Abstract:</b> We propose a novel class of multivariate GARCH models that utilize realized measures of volatilities and correlations. The central component is an unconstrained vector parametrization of the correlation matrix that facilitates modeling of the correlation structure. The parametrization is based on the matrix logarithmic transformation that retains the positive definiteness as an innate property. A factor approach offers a way to impose a parsimonious structure in high dimensional system and we show that a factor framework arises naturally in some existing models. We apply the model to returns of nine assets and employ the factor structure that emerges from a block correlation specification. An auxiliary empirical finding is that the empirical distribution of parametrized realized correlations is approximately Gaussian. This observation is analogous to the well-known result for logarithmically transformed realized variances.

					<script type="math/tex">\mathbb{R}^d,\ d = n(n-1)/2</script> to a distribution on the space of non-singular nxn correlation matrices. Correlation matrices with certain properties, such as being well-conditioned, having block structures, and having strictly positive elements, are simple to generate. We compare the new method with existing methods.

       			<p><b>Abstract:</b> We obtain a canonical representation for block matrices. The representation facilitates simple computation of the determinant, the matrix inverse, and other powers of a block matrix, as well as the matrix logarithm and the matrix exponential. These results are particularly useful for block covariance and block correlation matrices, where evaluation of the Gaussian log-likelihood and estimation are greatly simplified. We illustrate this with an empirical application using a large panel of daily asset returns. Moreover, the representation paves new ways to regularizing large covariance/correlation matrices, test block structures in matrices, and estimate regressions with many variables.

       			<p><b>Abstract:</b> We study recurrent patterns in volatility and volume for major cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ether, using data from two centralized exchanges (Coinbase Pro and Binance) and a decentralized exchange (Uniswap V2). We find systematic patterns in both volatility and volume across day-of-the-week, hour-of-the-day, and within the hour. These patterns have grown stronger over the years and can be related to algorithmic trading and funding times in futures markets. We also document that price formation mainly takes place on the centralized exchanges while price adjustments on the decentralized exchanges can be sluggish.

				Realized GARCH, CBOE VIX, and the Volatility Risk Premium

       			<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05302">[ArXiv]</a></p>
       			<p><b>Abstract:</b> We show that the Realized GARCH model yields close-form expression for both the Volatility Index (VIX) and the volatility risk premium (VRP). The Realized GARCH model is driven by two shocks, a return shock and a volatility shock, and these are natural state variables in the stochastic discount factor (SDF). The volatility shock endows the exponentially affine SDF with a compensation for volatility risk. This leads to dissimilar dynamic properties under the physical and risk-neutral measures that can explain time-variation in the VRP. In an empirical application with the S&P 500 returns, the VIX, and the VRP, we find that the Realized GARCH model significantly outperforms conventional GARCH models.

        			<p><b>Abstract:</b> We introduce a new volatility model for option pricing that combines Markov switching with the Realized GARCH framework. This leads to a novel pricing kernel with a state-dependent variance risk premium and a pricing formula for European options, which is derived with an analytical approximation method. We apply the Markov switching Realized GARCH model to S&P 500 index options from 1990 to 2019 and find that investors' aversion to volatility-specific risk is time-varying. The proposed framework outperforms competing models and reduces (in-sample and out-of-sample) option pricing errors by 15% or more.

				</p>
       			<p><b>Abstract:</b> We propose a simple dynamic model for estimating the relative contagiousness of two virus variants. Maximum likelihood estimation and inference is conveniently invariant to variation in the total number of cases over the sample period and can be expressed as a logistic regression. We apply the model to Danish SARS-CoV-2 variant data. We estimate the reproduction numbers of Alpha and Delta to be larger than that of the ancestral variant by a factor of 1.51 [CI 95%: 1.50, 1.53] and 3.28 [CI 95%: 3.01, 3.58], respectively. In a predominately vaccinated population, we estimate Omicron to be 3.15 [CI 95%: 2.83, 3.50] times more infectious than Delta. Forecasting the proportion of an emerging virus variant is straight forward and we proceed to show how the effective reproduction number for a new variant can be estimated without contemporary sequencing results. This is useful for assessing the state of the pandemic in real time as we illustrate empirically with the inferred effective reproduction number for the Alpha variant.

       			<p><b>Abstract:</b>
					We study parameter estimation from the sample <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{X}</script>, when
					the objective is to maximize the expected value of a criterion function,
					<script type="math/tex">Q</script>, for a distinct sample, <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{Y}</script>. This is the situation
					that arises when a model is estimated for the purpose of describing
					other data than those used for estimation, such as in forecasting
					problems. A natural candidate for solving <script type="math/tex">\max_{T\in\sigma(\mathcal{X})}\mathbb{E}Q(\mathcal{Y},T)</script>
					is the <i>innate</i> estimator, <script type="math/tex">\hat{\theta}=\arg\max_{\theta}Q(\mathcal{X},\theta)</script>.
					While the innate estimator has certain advantages, we show that the
					asymptotically efficient estimator takes the form <script type="math/tex">\tilde{\theta}=\arg\max_{\theta}\tilde{Q}(\mathcal{X},\theta)</script>,
					where <script type="math/tex">\tilde{Q}</script> is defined from a likelihood function in conjunction
					with <script type="math/tex">Q</script>. The likelihood-based estimator is, however, fragile, as
					misspecification is harmful in two ways. First, the likelihood-based
					estimator may be inefficient under misspecification. Second, and more
					importantly, the likelihood approach requires a parameter transformation
					that depends on the true model, causing an improper mapping to be
					used under misspecification.

				A Dynamic Model of Vaccine Compliance: How Fake News Undermined the Danish HPV Vaccine Program

       			<p><b>Abstract:</b> Increased vaccine hesitancy presents challenges to public health and undermines efforts to eradicate diseases such as measles, rubella, and polio. The decline is partly attributed to misconceptions that are shared on social media, such as the debunked association between vaccines and autism. Perhaps, more damaging to vaccine uptake are cases where trusted mainstream media run stories that exaggerate the risks associated with vaccines. It is important to understand the underlying causes of vaccine refusal, because these may be prevented, or countered, in a timely manner by educational campaigns. In this article, we develop a dynamic model of vaccine compliance that can help pinpoint events that disrupted vaccine compliance. We apply the framework to Danish HPV vaccine data, which experienced a sharp decline in compliance following the broadcast of a controversial TV documentary, and we show that media coverage significantly predicts vaccine uptake.

				Resilience of HPV Vaccine Uptake in Denmark: Decline and Recovery

       			<p><a href="papers/2020HansenSchmidtblaicherBrewer-Vaccine.pdf">[PDF]</a></p>
       			<p><b>Abstract:</b> Background: Immunization programs’ resilience to shocks is central to their success, but little empirical evidence documents resilience in action. We sought to characterize the decline of HPV vaccination in Denmark after negative media coverage and recovery during a national information campaign. Methods: We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of all girls born in Denmark from 1997 to 2006 (N = 328,779), aged 12–15. The outcome measure was HPV vaccine uptake (first dose), as reported to the Danish national health registry from 2009 to 2019, when HPV vaccine was freely available to girls in primary care clinics in Denmark. Events that created 4 natural time periods for study were HPV vaccine reaching the uptake of other vaccines in the national program (2009), some negative media cov- erage of HPV vaccination (2013), extensive negative media coverage (2015), and a national information campaign about the vaccine’s safety and effectiveness (2017–2019).
				Results: In the period with some negative media coverage, HPV vaccine uptake fell to 83.6% (95% CI:78.0%–89.7%) of baseline uptake. In the period with extensive negative media coverage, uptake fell even further to 49.6% (95% CI:44.5%–55.2%) of baseline uptake. After the information campaign, HPV vaccine uptake recovered to its baseline level (109.2%, 95% CI:90.1%–132.4%) due in part to catch-up doses. Despite the recovery, an estimated 26,000 fewer girls initiated the vaccine than if uptake had not declined.
				Conclusions: The experience in Denmark offers one of the first opportunities to document how a nation grappled with negative media coverage of HPV vaccination and the steadying impact of action by national authorities.

				The contagious nature of a vaccine scare: How the introduction of HPV vaccination lifted and eroded MMR vaccination in Denmark

       			<p><a href="papers/2020GoertzBrewerHansenEjrnaes-Vaccine.pdf">[PDF]</a></p>
       			<p><b>Abstract:</b> Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine coverage was high in Denmark until it plunged fol- lowing negative media coverage. We examined whether the decline in HPV vaccination undermined uptake of another adolescent vaccine, measles, mumps and rubella (MMR).
					Methods: The Danish national health register provided data on uptake of MMR vaccine dose 2 (at age 13) for children born from 1991 to 2003 (n = 827,716). The primary exposure variable comprised three time periods: before HPV vaccine introduction, during high HPV vaccine coverage, and after the drop in HPV vaccine coverage. To examine the effect of HPV vaccination on MMR2 uptake, we estimated MMR2 uptake by age 13 using logistic regression, controlling for gender, birth month, birth year, and maternal education.
					Findings: MMR2 vaccination coverage was high for both girls and boys (86% and 85%) in 2009. Following the introduction of HPV vaccine for girls in 2009, MMR2 coverage increased for girls even as it decreased for boys (gender gap 46 percentage points, 95% CI 43 to 48). Coverage with MMR2 for girls continued to be high over the following four years, and almost all girls (91%) who received MMR2 vaccination also received HPV1 vaccination within the same week. When negative media coverage led to a decline in HPV vaccination, MMR2 uptake for girls also declined. By 2015, MMR2 coverage for girls and boys had become similar again (80% and 79%). Families with the highest level of maternal education showed the strongest decline in MMR2 coverage for girls.
					Interpretation: Concomitant vaccine provision can increase overall vaccine uptake. However, reduced demand for one vaccine may reduce concomitant vaccination and undermine resiliency of a country’s vaccination program.

       			<p><b>Abstract:</b> We introduce the realized exponential GARCH model that can use multiple realized volatility measures for the modeling of a return series. The model specifies the dynamic properties of both returns and realized measures, and is characterized by a flexible modeling of the dependence between returns and volatility. We apply the model to 27 stocks and an exchange traded fund that tracks the S&P 500 index and find specifications with multiple realized measures that dominate those that rely on a single realized measure. The empirical analysis suggests some convenient simplifications and highlights the advantages of the new specification.
